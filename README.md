# N-vases
Two competitors Anna and Bob, draw marbles from N vases. Bob has a "backlog", meaning he must wait some time, before entering competition. Their draws can happen with different probabilites for each. 

Since there seems not to be a closed analytical solution to this problem, this solution simulates win chances for the backlogged competitor.

# Input (from keyboard)

The code is written in (multi-core) R and Rcpp.
