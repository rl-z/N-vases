# Nvases
Two competitors draw marbles from N vases (one has a backlog). Their draws can happen with different probabilites for each. 

Since there seems not to be a closed analytical solution to this problem, this solution simulates win chances for the backlogged competitor.
The code is written in (multi-core) R and Rcpp.
